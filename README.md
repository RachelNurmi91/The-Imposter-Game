# ImposterGame
In this browser game the player is given two semi-identical game boards covered in smiley faces. The difference is that one board has an additional smiley face. The player must find the additional face and click on it. If the player clicks on the wrong face the game ends and they no longer can continue. If the player guesses correctly five new faces are added to each side. Player is given the option to restart the game at any point.

### What I learned
While working on the Imposter Game I became much more familiar with the DOM and Nodes. I challenged myself to allow the user to reset the game without having to refresh the web page. In order to accomplish this I created a function that removed all the children of the existing nodes on both sides of the gameboard. Once that was done the function was set to generate new smiley faces for a fresh game.
